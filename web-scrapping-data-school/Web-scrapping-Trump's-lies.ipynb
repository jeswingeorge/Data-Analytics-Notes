    "This is a common scenario: You find a web page that contains data you want to analyze, but it's not presented in a format that you can easily download and read into your favorite data analysis tool. You might imagine manually copying and pasting the data into a spreadsheet, but in most cases, that is way too time consuming. A technique called web scraping is a useful way to automate this process.  \n",

    "1. The date of the lie.\n",
    "2. The lie itself (as a quotation).\n",
    "3. The writer's brief explanation of why it was a lie.\n",
    "4. The URL of an article that substantiates the claim that it was a lie.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, those fields have different formatting, which is consistent throughout the article: the date is bold red text, the lie is \"regular\" text, the explanation is gray italics text, and the URL is linked from the gray italics text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why does the formatting matter? Because it's very likely that the code underlying the web page \"tags\" those fields differently, and we can take advantage of that pattern when scraping the page. Let's take a look at the source code, known as HTML:\n",
    "\n",

    "You can see that the HTML contains the article text, along with \"tags\" (specified using angle brackets) that \"mark up\" the text. (\"HTML\" stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, one tag is <strong>, which means \"use bold formatting\". There is a _ <strong> tag before \"Jan. 21\" and a </strong> _ tag after it. The first is an \"opening tag\" and the second is a \"closing tag\" (denoted by the /), which indicates to the web browser where to start and stop applying the formatting. In other words, this tag tells the web browser to make the text \"Jan. 21\" bold. \n"
