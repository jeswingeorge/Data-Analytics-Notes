    "Remember the quality of your inputs decide the quality of your output. So, once you have got your business hypothesis ready, it makes sense to spend lot of time and efforts here. With my personal estimate, data exploration, cleaning and preparation can take up to 70% of your total project time.\n",

    "Below are the steps involved to understand, clean and prepare your data for building your predictive model:\n",

    "1. Variable Identification\n",

    "3. Bi-variate Analysis\n",

    "\n",
    "__Categorical Variables:__ For categorical variables, we’ll use frequency table to understand distribution of each category. We can also read as percentage of values under each category. It can be be measured using two metrics, __Count__ and __Count%__ against each category. Bar chart can be used as visualization.\n",

    "### 3. Bi-variate Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Bi-variate Analysis finds out the relationship between two variables. Here, we look for association and disassociation between variables at a pre-defined significance level. We can perform bi-variate analysis for any combination of categorical and continuous variables. The combination can be: Categorical & Categorical, Categorical & Continuous and Continuous & Continuous. Different methods are used to tackle these combinations during analysis process.\n",

    "Let’s understand the possible combinations in detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "__Continuous & Continuous:__ While doing bi-variate analysis between two continuous variables, we should look at scatter plot. It is a nifty way to find out the relationship between two variables. The pattern of scatter plot indicates the relationship between variables. The relationship can be linear or non-linear.\n",
